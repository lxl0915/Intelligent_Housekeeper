# Intelligent_Housekeeper
This is the code for my undergraduate graduation project, called Intelligent_Housekeeper. It runs on the ARM Contex-A9 platform and has basic functions such as video surveillance of the environment, temperature and humidity information acquisition, alarm for specific situations, and interaction with the client.
